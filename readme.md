Call for developers: Because we have switched to Omnipod 5, we no longer are using Loop or Nightscout. I will not be able to do maintenance on the features related to those. If you are interested in assisting to keep this app maintained and work on new features and improvements for Loop and Nightscout functionality, please reach out.

### Fork from https://github.com/jonfawcett/LoopFollow - all credit to Jon Fawcett for Loop Follow. Updates here are tweaks to support FAX/OpenAPS looping, some minor visual updates for personal preference/device support, and small features for additional data on Apple Watch/calendar entries.

### Purpose:

Using so many different apps as a parent or caregiver of a T1D can be very cumbersome. Add in the extra details from Looping
and it can be a challenge flipping back and forth between apps. Each app has different strengths and weaknesses.
- Spike is great for alarms. 
- Spike and Sugarmate are great for the calendar complication on Apple Watch. 
- Nightscout X or Nightscout in Safari are needed for intricate details from NS.
- IFTTT and Pushover are  needed for Not Looping alerts.

And there are some functions I've always wished for and not found anywhere such a one-time temporary alert
for those nights when Loop is stuck on high and you open loop with a correction. This lets you set a higher
low alert for the BG you want to wake up to and close Loop.

### Building Options

### GitHub Browser Build

Loop Follow can be built using a paid Apple Developer Account on any computer using the GitHub Browser Build method as explained (tersely) [here](fastlane/testflight.md) or with more detail in [LoopDocs: GitHub Browser Build: Other Apps](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-other-apps).

If you choose GitHub Browser Build and want to run Loop Follow on your Mac, you need to install the TestFlight app on your Mac. The TestFlight app shows the same set of builds and uses the same installation procedure as shown in LoopDocs for installing apps on a phone from TestFlight; just do it on your Mac.

Note:

If you have a Loop Follow app in your Applications folder from a prior Mac/Xcode build and then install from TestFlight:

* TestFlight does not ask if you want to replace your app - you get a second app, Loop Follow 2.app, in your Applications folder
* You can then delete the original Loop Follow.app and rename the TestFlight version from Loop Follow 2.app to Loop Follow.app
* Subsequent installations from TestFlight overwrite the app
* Your settings are maintained regardless of the app name

### Build using Mac/Xcode

Loop Follow can be built using a Mac computer with Xcode as described below (tersely) or with more detail using the Build-Select script, see [Loop and Learn: Build-Select Script](https://www.loopandlearn.org/build-select) or [LoopDocs: Build Select Script](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/step14/#build-select-script) and choose to build Loop Follow.

1. Open Terminal
2. copy/paste this code into terminal and hit enter:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/JTKEt)"
```
3. Follow instructions in terminal
4. Plugin your phone or ipad, select your signing team, select your phone or ipad or "my mac" (Big Sur or later operating systems), and click play.

Note: Tested this with Ventura and Xcode 14.2, and successfully built to

* My Mac (Mac Catalyst)
* My Mac (Mac Catalyst, Rosetta)
* My Mac (Designed for iPad)
    * I did not test the app on the iPad, but it built with no problem

### Run Loop Follow on Mac

To run Loop Follow on your Mac, you need to move the app to your Applications folder.

After building to your Mac:
1. Click stop to close the running app
1. On the left side of Xcode, click on the Folder icon
    * Click to open the LoopFollow folder list
    * Click to open the LoopFollow/Products folder
    * Right click (or Cntl-click) on "Loop Follow.app" and select Show in Finder
4. Drag the Loop Follow.app icon to your Applications folder in finder (see Note below)
5. From Mac system settings/notifications, scroll down to Loop Follow and enable notifications with the options you want. For instance, Badge app icon will allow the BG reading to display on the icon.

Note:

If you have a Loop Follow app in your Applications folder from a prior TestFlight installation, then when you drag the Loop (from Finder location) to Applications, you will be asked if you want to Replace or Keep Both. Choose Replace.

** Big Sur **
Some things do not work correctly yet in Big Sur
- Background Refresh. Mac apps stay open when minimized, so this is unneeded. Please disable the toggle switch.
- Disable Keep Screen Active. I haven't tested, but doubt this will do anything.
- Watch/Carplay calendar selection does not work
- Alarms will not override the Mac volume or mute.

Special thanks to Spike-App, NSApple, and Nightguard for helping me figure out how to do a lot of the code for this.

If you want to contribute, the biggest needs today are to make the code cleaner and more efficient, and create the basis for a watch app.

### General feature list
- scrollable/scalable graph display with BG, basal, bolus, and carb details plus Loop status, Loop Prediction, and the General NS Care portal info.
- Override DND and system volume for all alerts.
- snoozes per alert, presnooze, edit existing snooze, and snooze all alert settings.
- the standard Low/High, Urgent Low/High, and missed reading alerts. High will have a persistence option that’s still to do. Eg high for x minutes.
- fast drop/rise alerts with BG limits. Eg Trigger fast drop only when under a BG where it’s an issue.
- sage/cage reminder alerts for x hours before change.
- Not Looping with Bg limits alert. So you can trigger the alert only if under or over a BG range.
- Missed Bolus alert.
- calendar entries to use watch complication with BG, arrow, delta, cob, iob and minutes ago (if old reading).
- background silent audio to keep iOS from killing the app. This is why it can’t go in the App Store for just a simple download.

### Open Source DIY
- This is a DIY open source project that may or may not function as you expect. You take full responsibility for building and running this app and do so at your own risk.
